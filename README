xmUtil - Xmodem file transfer utility

Author: Markus Wiik <vassius@gmail.com>

This is a small utility for transferring a kernel image to a Raspberry Pi. The RPi is
assumed to run a bootloader which receives files via the Xmodem protocol. This 
program has been tested using dwelch67's bootloader05 
(https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/bootloader05), but should work 
with any standards compliant xmodem receiver. 

xmUtil has been developed, compiles and runs on Mac OS X 10.8. Although I havn't 
tested, it should work on any POSIX system. 

xmUtil is MIT licensed. For details, read the LICENSE file.
